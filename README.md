# ðŸš€ 100 Days Coding Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days Coding Challenge**! This repository is where I will document my journey as I commit to coding every day for 100 days. The goal is to improve my coding skills, build new projects, and develop a consistent coding habit.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

I am participating in the 100 Days Coding Challenge to enhance my programming skills and discipline. Each day, I will spend at least one hour coding and will document my progress here. The projects and tasks I work on may vary, including solving coding problems, building applications, or learning new technologies.

## ðŸ“œ Rules

1. **Code for at least one hour every day**: Consistency is key.
2. **Log my progress**: Keep this log updated with my daily progress.
3. **Be honest**: If I miss a day, I will log it and resume the next day. The goal is to develop a habit, not to be perfect.
4. **Share my journey**: If I want, I can share my progress on social media with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode to connect with others.
